## Usage

### CLI Version
To extract subtitles from an MKV file, use the `-x` or `--extract` flag followed by the path to the MKV file:

## PGS to SRT Conversion Process

The application includes a powerful feature to convert PGS/SUP subtitle files (image-based subtitles) to SRT format (text-based subtitles) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This process involves several steps:

### How It Works

1. **Extraction**: First, the PGS subtitles are extracted from the MKV file using `mkvextract` as .sup files

2. **OCR Processing**: The extracted .sup files are then processed using a Deno-based script that:
   - Decodes the PGS/SUP format to extract individual subtitle frames
   - Uses Tesseract OCR to convert the subtitle images to text
   - Preserves timing information from the original subtitles
   - Formats the output as a standard SRT file

3. **Real-time Feedback**: During conversion, the application provides:
   - Progress updates
   - Elapsed time tracking
   - Detailed logs of the conversion process

### Requirements for OCR

- **Deno Runtime**: Required to execute the conversion script
- **Tesseract OCR**: The underlying OCR engine used for text recognition
- **Tessdata Files**: Language training data for Tesseract (English data included by default)

### Performance Considerations

- OCR conversion is CPU-intensive and may take significant time for longer subtitle tracks
- The quality of the OCR results depends on several factors:
  - Resolution and clarity of the original PGS subtitles
  - Font style used in the original subtitles
  - Language of the subtitles (English works best with the default configuration)

### Troubleshooting OCR Conversion

- If conversion fails, check that Deno is properly installed and in your PATH
- Verify that the Tesseract language data files are available
- For poor OCR quality, you may need to adjust the conversion parameters in the script
- The application creates detailed logs that can help diagnose conversion issues

## VobSub to SRT Conversion Process

The application also supports converting VobSub subtitles (.idx/.sub files) to SRT format using OCR technology. This feature works similarly to the PGS conversion but uses the vobsub2srt tool.

### How It Works

1. **Extraction**: First, the VobSub subtitles are extracted from the MKV file using `mkvextract` as .idx and .sub files

2. **OCR Processing**: The extracted files are then processed using the vobsub2srt tool that:
   - Reads the subtitle images from the .sub file and the timing information from the .idx file
   - Uses Tesseract OCR to convert the subtitle images to text
   - Automatically handles language detection and mapping
   - Formats the output as a standard SRT file

3. **Language Support**: The conversion process requires proper language mapping:
   - MKV files typically use 3-letter language codes (e.g., 'eng', 'fre', 'ger')
   - The vobsub2srt tool uses 2-letter language codes (e.g., 'en', 'fr', 'de')
   - The application automatically maps between these formats
   - You can manually select the OCR language from a dropdown menu for better accuracy

### Requirements for VobSub Conversion

- **vobsub2srt**: The command-line tool that performs the actual conversion
   - Should be installed at `/usr/local/bin/vobsub2srt`
   - Can be built from [VobSub2SRT GitHub repository](https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT)
- **Tesseract OCR**: The underlying OCR engine used for text recognition
- **Tessdata Files**: Language training data for Tesseract

./gmmmkvsubsextract -x /path/to/yourfile.mkv

### GUI Version
1. Load an MKV file using one of these methods:
   - Click "Select MKV File" to choose your MKV file using the file dialog
   - Or simply drag and drop an MKV file onto the application window
2. The output directory is automatically set to the same location as your MKV file
   - You can change it by clicking "Change Output Directory" if needed
3. Click "Load Tracks" to see available subtitle tracks
4. Select the subtitle tracks you want to extract/convert
5. Click "Start Extract" to begin the process
6. Monitor the progress in the application window

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or later
- Fyne dependencies: [Fyne Getting Started](https://developer.fyne.io/started/)

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `fyne-gui` directory
3. Run the build script: `./build.sh`

For cross-compilation, you may need additional tools:
- For Windows builds on macOS: `brew install mingw-w64`
- For Linux builds on macOS: `brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross`

## Dependency Auto-Install

Subtitle Forge v1.5 introduces a new feature that automatically detects missing dependencies and offers to install them for you:

1. **Automatic Detection**: When you start the application, it checks for all required dependencies
2. **Installation Prompt**: If any dependencies are missing, you'll see a notification with an "Install" button
3. **One-Click Installation**: Click the button to automatically install the missing dependency
4. **Progress Tracking**: A progress dialog shows the installation status
5. **Completion Notification**: You'll be notified when installation is complete

### Supported Dependencies

- **ffmpeg**: For media processing and subtitle conversion
- **mkvtoolnix** (mkvmerge, mkvextract): For working with MKV files
- **vobsub2srt**: For converting VobSub subtitles to SRT format

### Requirements

- **Homebrew**: On macOS, dependencies are installed via Homebrew
- **sudo access**: Some installations may require administrator privileges
- **cmake**: Required for building vobsub2srt from source
- **tesseract**: Required for OCR functionality

## Troubleshooting

- The application automatically checks for required dependencies at startup
- Missing dependencies will be clearly indicated in the application window with an option to install them
- If automatic installation fails, detailed error messages will guide you through manual installation
- Ensure Deno, mkvmerge, and mkvextract are in your PATH
- Check the conversion logs in the output directory
- For permission issues, try running the application with administrator privileges

## Updating the Application

If you've previously cloned the repository and want to update to the latest version, follow these steps:

### Clean Update (Recommended)
1. Remove any local build artifacts before pulling:
   ```sh
   cd gmmmkvsubsextract
   rm -rf fyne-gui/build/*
   git pull
   ```

### If You Encounter Conflicts
If you see errors like "Your local changes would be overwritten by merge", you can:

1. Stash your local changes:
   ```sh
   git stash
   git pull
   ```
   
2. Or discard local changes to specific files:
   ```sh
   git checkout -- fyne-gui/build/
   git pull
   ```

3. After updating, rebuild the application:
   ```sh
   cd fyne-gui
   ./build.sh
   ```
